# Modelling-Sessions-2-3
# Poker Hand Project (Advanced OOP Practice)

This project was part of what we did in class during Sessions 3 & 4, where the teacher went over some advanced OOP topics like:

- Inheritance
- Properties
- Static methods

After the lesson, I wanted to try building a small project using these ideas. I worked on a **poker hand simulator**, where a hand of 5 cards is dealt and the code checks if itâ€™s a pair or a flush.

### What I did:
I got help from ChatGPT for the poker part especially with structuring the classes and checking for flush/pair. It was useful for understanding how inheritance and properties actually work in code.

### What I did myself:
After that, I tried applying the same logic to a **pet class** I made separately on my own (not included here), to test if I could do similar things without help. That part I wrote without assistance.

### What the poker code does:
- Makes a 52-card deck
- Deals a hand of 5 cards
- Checks if the hand is a pair or a flush
- Inherits from a basic hand class to add extra features like "high card"
- Uses a static method to generate the result
